2. System Overview
 
Our email generation system operates on a streamlined architecture designed to create highly personalized customer communications. The process begins with the input of a unique customer ID, which triggers the extraction of relevant details from CSV files. This data is then organized into a structured dictionary and transformed into a tailored email prompt template. The core of our system, the LLM Chain, integrates this template with the Google Gemini language model, enabling the generation of human-like, contextually appropriate email content. The generated content undergoes further refinement through an additional prompt template, ensuring a polished and personalized result. 
This approach efficiently combines customer data, recommended products, and advanced language modeling to deliver engaging and relevant email communications at scale.
 
2.1 Architecture

 The system architecture follows these key steps: 
· Input a unique customer ID
· Extract all relevant customer details from CSV files, and organized them into a dictionary
· Transform the dictionary's keys and values into a structured email prompt template
· Process the templated data through an LLM Chain
· Refine the generated content using another prompt template and LLM Chain
· Produce the final personalized email

 
2.2 Components

The major components of our system include:

· CSV Agent: Extracts customer data from CSV files based on the unique customer ID

· Data Transformation: Converts extracted customer data into a structured dictionary

· Email Prompt Template: A customizable template that incorporates customer-specific data

· LLM Chain:
Combines the email prompt template with the Google Gemini LLM
Acts as a bridge between the structured prompt and the language model
Enables the LLM to generate human-like, contextually appropriate email content based on the input data

· Refinement Prompt: A secondary template used to further personalize and polish the email content

· Email Generation: The final step that produces a tailored email for each customer.

 
 
2.3 WORKFLOW:
 
v Data Preparation:

Load customer data from a CSV file ("final_Emarketing.csv").
Define a list of customer IDs to process.
 
 
v LLM Setup:
 
Initialize the Google Gemini Pro model with a specific API key.
 
 
v Data Extraction:
 
Create a CSV agent using the Lang Chain library
For each customer ID, query the CSV agent to extract relevant customer information
Convert the extracted data into a dictionary format.
 
 
v Email Template Creation:
 
Define a basic email template with placeholders for customer-specific information
Process the extracted data to fit the template format (e.g., cleaning product lists).
 
 
v Initial Email Generation:
 
Use a Prompt Template to fill in the basic email template with customer data
Generate an initial formatted email for each customer.
 
 
v Email Refinement:
 
Create a final prompt template for email enhancement
Use an LLM Chain with the Gemini Pro model to refine each initial email
The refinement process aims to make emails more compelling and clearer, with optional formatting improvements (e.g., listing recommended products).
 
 
v Output:
 
Print the final, refined email for each customer and store in new csv file.


 
This workflow demonstrates a sophisticated approach for generating personalized customer emails using LLMs and structured data processing.
 





3. Data Collection
 
v Data Sources:
Our company's internal data team serves as our primary data source.


v Data Pipeline:
The data pipeline is managed by our data team, ensuring a smooth flow of information.

v Data Schema:

Raw Data Collection:
 
The data team extracts raw data from the Odoo platform.
This data includes customer information and purchase history.
 
 
v Recommendation System:
 
Our recommendation team uses this raw data to build a recommendation system.
They identify recommended products for each unique customer.
 
 
v CSV Creation:
 
The recommendation team creates a CSV file containing the processed data.
This file is then provided to our team for further use.
  
v LLM Application:
 
We apply a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized email content.
 
 
For the LLM email generation process, we use the following features:
 
v Customer_ID: A unique identifier for each customer
v Purchased products: List of products the customer has bought
v Email: Customer's email address
v Name: Customer's name
v Recommended products: Products suggested by the recommendation system
v Date purchased: The date when products were bought.

 
 4. Email Generation 
 
v Data Processing: This is a batch processing approach where we take a list of customer IDs and process them in groups.

v LLM Integration: We utilize the Google Gemini Pro model for natural language generation, integrated through the Lang Chain library.

v Personalization Pipeline:
Data Extraction: Use a CSV agent to retrieve customer-specific information.
Template Creation: Apply a basic email template with placeholders for customer data.
Initial Formatting: Fill the template with extracted customer information.

v Refinement: Employ an LLM Chain to enhance and personalize the email content. 
Customization Rules: The refinement process includes instructions to:
Make emails compelling and clear
Optionally format recommended products as numbered lists
Ensure variation between generated emails
Present products and recommendations in bullet point format

This approach combines structured data processing with advanced language modeling to create personalized, engaging customer emails at scale.


  	                    



 

5. Challenges and Limitations
 
The output of the LLM model is hard to control and predict. It generates tokens in ways that are unpredictable, which makes it tough to ensure consistent and clear output. Sometimes, it gives accurate information but in a confusing way, leading to misunderstandings. Also, managing different writing styles across different contexts adds to the challenge. Plus, running the LLM requires a lot of computational power, which adds to the complexity and cost. Despite these challenges, working through them helps us use the LLM effectively.
