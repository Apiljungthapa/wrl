This place has a very wonderful atmosphere with a great selection. Love this place. The people that work there are kind and very hostible.

I would recommend this place as the best Cigar shop in Miami Dade County for all does Cigars enthusiast The person who is running the place on is just rude and has poor customer relation skills. I would never recommend this place to anyone I care about. I think he is upset because the businesses on both sides of him have more customers than he does.

      "Great selection of cigars - hand rolled for as little as $5, with the nice ones ranging from $13-60 depending on preference. Highly recommend. Great service by Wellington. The air ventilation is not great, gets stuffy. Have purchased from this company for over 3 years . First time with a problem.  They do not answer telephone calls or respond to emails. ‚Ä¶ More Knowledgeable guy at counter, good variety. Not the best I've been to regarding variety but definitely the best in the area.

Will drive on down the road for working pumps & cheaper gas. Fuel pumps never has paper to print receipts. I think, is their strategy to bring customers to the shop. Locking the doors at night but leaving gas pumps on does NOT make your store 24 hours!! You have someone in there but they won't even work the grab and go box. What a joke.

      "Old school Key West bar, a must while in town Nice bar. Competent staff. Lots of History Behind These Bars and yes there is a clothing-optional bar on the third floor.  Go to the third floor peel down get naked knock it off your bucket list Fun place. Great bartenders! Good drinks and live music My favorite place to people watch in Key West. It's a must every time we visit! Excellent food This place is not actually called habibi anything, but it is a great complex of several bars/one restaurant. These guys have no ethics when it comes to keeping customers safe. I was almost killed by three of them and their irresponsible use of force. They caused a lot of physical and mental damages, no responsibility by the bar because they don't ‚Ä¶ More\n"
